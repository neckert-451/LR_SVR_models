# linear_regression_model
This repo contains all the data and code for investigating the output difference and prediction results of conventional statistical models (six sigma and DOE methods) and machine learning models. Linear regression (LR) was chosen to represent conventional statistical models and support vector regression (SVR) was chosen to represent the machine learning model.

LR model: includes scatter plot graph, stats, and equation of linear fit.
SVR model: includes scatter plot graph and stats.
